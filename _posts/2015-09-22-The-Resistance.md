Who are the spies?! The Resistance is a social deduction game. It is similar to mafia, but doesn’t have the player elimination mechanic.

<b>Story:</b>

A small group of rebellions are trying to overthrow the evil and corrupt empire. There are a few spies hidden within their ranks and the group must work together to identify the spies!   A new leader gets to send a specific amount of people (depends on the total number of players) on a mission. Everyone gets to voice their opinions and speculations. Then the leader makes the ultimate decision for that round on who to send. But, the majority needs to agree so there's a vote before the final decision. Be careful not to send a spy (or spies)!

<b>Goal:</b>

If you’re on the blue team (rebellions), then you want to complete 3 out of 5 missions. To guarantee the success of the mission, you want to send yourself and your fellow non-spy peers.
 
If you’re on the red team (spies), then you want to send yourself (or your fellow spies) on the mission. You want to secretly sabotage the blue team’s plan by throwing in the fail card!

I’ve played this game so many times with various groups of people and each time it is very different. There are also many different methods that you can change up the game. For example, you can play with the expansion with a Commander and Assassin. You can try playing a whole game with blind spies so they don’t know who the other spies are. Or you can secretly not put in a spy card and watch the world burn with everyone yelling at each other. It is definitely one of those games that is still fun and interesting to watch other people play.

We have a lot of funny stories from playing this game. My favorite was when we had our house warming party. We had a bunch of games out for people to play and there were a few new players that wanted to try Resistance. My fiancé, who is the rules master, was blackout drunk. He was sitting there on the floor surrounded by our friends while explaining the rules of the game. He finished the whole explanation perfectly and nobody even noticed that he was drunk . They were completely oblivious until he started repeating the instructions again. We played it so many times that I guess he has the instructions deeply ingrained into his brain.

I’ve seen people swear on their die-hard fan status of a specific celebrity or band that they’re not the spy. Some people even promised to buy some kind of snack (or aka boba) for the leader to gain their trust to go on a mission. It’s hilarious how far some people will go to convince someone that they’re not the spy. The interactions that people have playing this game is hilarious and you might not get it until you play.

Another story was when we were playing one night at a family get together. I was the spy 12 times!! Not just a few times, but TWELVE! We played a total of 15-18 games and I was the only one that was consistently a spy. The group was big, about 8-9 players so there were plenty of other people that could’ve been the spies. It was ridiculous how bad my luck was that night. I tried picking first, picking last, had random people pick the cards for me. It was just horrible! The game became boring for me after being the spy for 5-6 times because no one believed me after that. Not like I’ve ever made any outrageous promise that I wasn’t the spy. I guess I should’ve tried doing that! The chances of this happening is so rare, but I guess it just had to happen to me.

Some people are just good at bluffing. I’m one of those that are horrible at it. So, if I’m the spy, I rarely get sent on a mission. According to my fiancé, I get very defensive when I’m accused of being a spy when I’m not. So, armed with this knowledge, I was able to use this tip and tricked him a few times. But Shhhh… don’t tell anyone my secret!

<b>Why I like this game:</b>

* It’s a great party and team game to play with friends and family
* Easy to learn
* It trains me to pay more attention to people’s body language
* There’s always a funny story from playing this game

I definitely recommend the game. It’s a good introduction game to get your friends and family interested in the modern board games. At least that is what happened with our friends. Several of them have their own copy so they can play with their family and different sets of friends.
