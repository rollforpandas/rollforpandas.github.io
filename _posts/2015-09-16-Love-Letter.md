This is one of my favorite games to take on a trip. It's small and compact enough that it's very easy to slip into your luggauge - or better yet, your purse or backpack!

Love Letter is very fast-paced so you don't have to worry about keeping score before moving out to your next activity during your trip! Also, this game has very minimal language dependency so you can play with someone that speaks a completely differently language (of course after learning how to count 1-8)!
