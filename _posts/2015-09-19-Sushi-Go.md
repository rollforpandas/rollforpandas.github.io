You're not supposed to judge a book by it's cover, same rule applies to board games. But, Sushi Go! is definitely an exception. Look at how adorable this game is! The design is not only undeniably cute, it's also super fun! By the end of the game, you'll be craving sushi (or dumplings).

We picked up Sushi Go! last year to use as a raffle prize for the board game party that we host at our house. It was oh so cute that I wanted to keep it for ourselves! Don't worry, I didn't. I can't deny that I didn't think long and hard about it though! ;)

<br>

This game is so awesome that after we gave it away during the raffle, we had to go pick up another copy for ourselves! This is absolutely one of my most favorite filler games. It's just so adorable, how can you possibly say no?

<i><b><font size="5" color="red">Goal:</font></b> During the 3 rounds of card drafting, you want to have the best meal with the most points! A meal is not complete without dessert so don't forget to get your pudding!</i>

<br>

The game comes with a total of 108 cards: 12 different types

![All the sushi](/img/galleries/sushi-go-pics/sushi-go-1_edit.jpg)

* <b>chopsticks</b> - allows you to pick 2 cards the next turn of your choice. When you use the chopsticks to pick 2 cards, return the chopsticks back to the stack
* <b>wasabi</b> - you need to place this down 1st before placing your nigiri. This card will allow you to x3 your nigiri points
* <b>squid nigiri</b> - 3 pts (on top of wasabi = 9 pts)
* <b>salmon nigiri</b> - 2 pts (on top of wasabi card = 6 pts)
* <b>egg nigiri</b> - 1 pt (on top of wasabi card = 3 pts)
* <b>maki rolls</b> - the player with the most maki rolls win 6 pts and 2nd most wins 3 pts. If there's a tie then you split the points between the players
* <b>tempura</b> - 2 shrimp tempura = 5 pts (1 card = 0 pt)
* <b>sashimi</b> - 3 sashimi cards = 10 pts (1-2 sashimi = 0 pt)
* <b>dumplings</b> - more dumplings = more points
* <b>pudding</b> - player with the most pudding gets 6 pts, player with the least gets -6 pts. If there's a tie, the points awarded/deducted are evenly split out. So, don't forget your pudding! No meal is complete without dessert!

<i><u><b>Quick how to play:</b></u></i>
1. shuffle the deck
2. refer to the rule book to see how many cards to deal to each player (ex: 9 cards per player in a 3 player game)
3. look at your hand, keep it a secret from your opponent
4. pick one card and place it down
5. when everyone is ready, reveal the card that you chose
6. pass the rest of the cards in your hand to your opponents- alternating rounds. (i.e. rounds 1 and 3 clockwise and round 2 counter-clockwise)
7. after each round, add up the points (excluding the pudding until the 3rd round)
8. discard all cards into the discard pile except the pudding cards
9. deal the cards again (play for 3 rounds)
10. count up all the cards for the 3rd round
11. add the points from pudding
12. player with the most points win

Examples of 3 different hands during the first round (so ignore the pudding for now)
![Player1](/img/galleries/sushi-go-pics/sushi-go-2-edit.jpg)
Player 1: total points is 4 pts (2 salmon nigiri) + 1 pt (dumpling) + 3 pts (2nd most maki rolls) = 8 pts. It looks like a complete meal, but the sets aren't complete. 

![Player2](/img/galleries/sushi-go-pics/sushi-go-4_edit.jpg)
Player 2: total points: 2 pts (2 dumplings) + 9 pts (3 from wasabi x 3 from squid nigiri) + 1 (egg nigiri) = 12 pts.

![Player3](/img/galleries/sushi-go-pics/sushi-go-5_edit.jpg)
Player 3: total points: 5 (2 tempuras) + 6 (3 from wasabi x 2 from salmon nigiri) + 1 (nigiri) + 6 (most maki rolls) = 18 pts.

![Box](/img/galleries/sushi-go-pics/sushi-go-box_edit.jpg)

The game comes in a small tin can with cute sushi design. It's very nice to take with you for traveling. The tin can protects the cards from getting damaged.

Also, there's the black plastic card holder that keep them nice and neat. The instructions book is small and easy to read. It's so simple that new gamers can pick it up really fast.

* Did I mention how adorable the design for this game is yet? It's just too cute! I absolutely love it! My friends always comment on how cute it is.


* Putting aside the cuteness, I think my 2nd favorite aspect is that it makes a great travel game. If you're going to be stuck at the airport or in the hotel, this is the game for you. The tin box will protect your game from getting damaged. The best part is, it's only $10 so you don't have to be sad if you happened to lose it during your traveling.


* We have some family members that don't speak English fluently. They usually want to join in, but the games are usually too hard for them to follow. So, we always leave them out of games that are too complicated. This game doesn't need any communication. You're just strategizing and picking your cards. Super easy for everyone.

* We played this game during our engagement shoot. Since my fiance and I are such board game geeks, we had to incorporate it into our wedding. So, this game also holds a special place in my heart. (Stay tuned for a post on our the engagement shoot with Sushi-Go!)

* I love card drafting games! It's super fun. This is a very light version of card drafting and it's a nice gateway game for those that also might like it.

 I tried really hard to come up with something that I dislike about this game, but I couldn't think of anything. The game is light and fun enough for everyone to enjoy. There's a lot of replayability. Everything that I can think of is positive. It's just an overall great game.
