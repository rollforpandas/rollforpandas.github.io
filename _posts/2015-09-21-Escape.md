This is what you will hear a lot of when you play Escape: The Curse of the Temple. This is a super-fast paced co-op game- exactly 10 minutes long with a soundtrack to let you know when time is up.

You and your crew were out exploring an ancient temple. During the exploration, you guys found some gems and decided to take them. Your team took too many gems and now the temple will collapse within 10 minutes. Everyone needs to find the exit out of the temple before it collapses! The door will not open unless you put enough gems back on the altar. That’s not all! Did I mention that there are traps? Nothing like a cursed temple without traps to thwart your exit plan! The traps activate twice during the game and you need to make your way back to the safe room before the gong rings. (Yes, there is a soundtrack for this game!)

<b>Green gems</b> – you need to get rid of these before you’ll be able to exit the temple
<b>Black mask</b> – locked, you can’t roll that dice until you roll a golden mask
<b>Gold mask</b> – unlocks 2 black mask, can be transfer to unlock other players on the same tile as you
<b>Green explorer, torch, keys</b> – items that you need to move on to the next tile or to get rid of the green gem or curses.

<br>

All players roll their dice and perform their actions simultaneously. You all start off on the same tile and explore the temple to get rid of the gems, while trying to find the exit. (Hopefully, in groups so you don’t get locked and end up alone!)

<br>

![1st Round](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_beginner.jpg)

The first round to introduce new players doesn’t have any curses (above picture). But once they've successfully completed the first round, we introduce curses into the game (below picture).

<br>
There are various curses in the game. If you can't get rid of it then you're stuck with that curse until the end of the game.
![Curses](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_curses.jpg)

* <b>Lost dice:</b> Each die that falls off the table is permanent lost
* <b>Broken die:</b> One of your dice is broken and can only be retrieved after you have lifted the curse
* <b>Mask:</b> You (or the player of your choice in the same chamber as you) can only re-roll 1 black mask for 1 golden mask until the curse is lifted
* <b>Silence:</b> You're not allowed to talk
* <b>Cursed hand:</b> Place one hand on your forehead and keep it there until the curse is lifted
* <b>Trap:</b> You may not enter or discover a chamber

<br>

![Treasure](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_treasure.JPG)
You need to roll 2 keys to retrieve the treasures. All of these can only be used once.
* <b>Teleport:</b> you can move to another chamber that contains at least 1 other adventurer. The chambers don't need to be next to each other 
* <b>Double torch:</b> serves as 2 torch icons 
* <b>Healing mask:</b> all adventurers may re-roll all of their black masks immediately 
* <b>Double key:</b> serves as 2 key icons 
* <b>Extra gem:</b> take a gem from the depot and place t on this treasure tile. It is considered activated until the end of the game
* <b>Secret passage:</b> place this between 2 adjacent chambers that have no open passage between them (can be used by all adventurers until end of game)


<br>

Not like trying to escape the temple without locking all your dice isn’t hard already! I think the curses and treasures make it a lot harder and interesting.

<br>
![Box](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_box.jpg)

![Contents](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_content.jpg)

* starting chamber
* exit
* gem chambers (x4)
* basic chamber tiles - without purple masks and/or treasure icon (only need the chambers with purple masks and/or treasure icon only if you want to play the "Treasure" and/or "Curses" module)
* gem depot (for magic gems)
* magic gems (x25)
* dice (x25)
* adventurer figures (x5)
* CD soundtrack and audio introduction
* supplement for 2 modules "Curses" and "Treasures"
* supplment for expansion "The Sand of Fortune"

<br>

![Box](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_packaging.jpg)

I think the box is a little big for the components that it comes with. There's a lot of empty room in there so everything moves around a lot even after I've organized it neatly. I think it's probably because we don't have any of the expansions. To me, the "Curses" and "Treasure" modules don't really count as part of the expansions. Even though they say they're "expansions" they're still part of the base game when you buy it.

<br>

* very fast paced - it doesn’t matter if you have a super slow player with you, the game WILL end in 10 minutes
* thrilling – the soundtrack of this game really gets your heart racing, especially when the traps are about to be activated or the temple is about to collapse
* very simple rules – new players can get into it pretty quickly
* language independent - You only need to know 1 word: “locked." You can play the game with someone that doesn’t speak English. Of course, you need someone who is able to speak the other language to explain the rules. Aside from that you can play without knowing anything else.
* LOTS of dice rolling! Of course, don’t roll off the table when you’re cursed with that card!

![Lost Dice](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_offtable.jpg)

<b>NOTE:</b> I absolutely LOVE rolling dice! (if you couldn't tell already...) The "Lost Dice" curse is like my worst nightmare. My friends comment on my dice rolling ways... that I sometimes roll a little to wildly and hard. But, I feel like my style makes my rolls better! Yes, I understand the rules of probability, but I just FEEL luckier. I don't usually roll my dice off the table. haha... just knocking things over on the table with my rolls sometimes. Anyways, I never try to lift the "Lost Dice" curse because I feel like it's a waste of time for me. But oh boy, it definitely bites me in the butt sometimes when I happen to actually roll it off the table!

<br>

There's nothing that I don't like about this game. The only thing that bothers me is how the box is too big (as mentioned above). When I organize the box neatly and move it to our board game shelf, the components inside move because there's too much room. It probably isn't a flaw from the designers and publishers of the game though. The box is probably intended to be used for storing the other expansion packs, which we don't have. Aside from that, I can't think of anything else that I dislike about this game.

<font size="6" color="#0B0B61"><b><u>STORIES:</u></b></font>

<br>

Every time we play, one or more of these occurs. Perhaps it's just my group of friends, but I think some of these are pretty funny and wanted to share with you.

<br>

<b>Lone Explorer</b>
![Lone Explorer](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_exit.jpg)

There’s always one person who venture out on their own and end up locking themselves up with all black masks. Everyone needs to be in the safe room when the traps get activated otherwise, they will get hurt (lose 1 die). So, someone needs to go and rescue this player. The player that leaves to rescue the other player could (usually does) end up locking their dice too.

<br>

<b>Consecutive Curses</b>
![Consecutive Curses](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_playercurses.jpg)

There’s also another type of player. The player that doesn't explore tiles because they don’t want to get cursed. Of course, I didn’t know this… I thought I was just super unlucky and got cursed EVERY.SINGLE. TIME! I'm usually way too concentrated on rolling my dice. I wouldn’t even know that they were waiting for me and didn't attempt to explore the new tiles. I only found out when I said, “Man, I’m always so unlucky with those curses!” and they fessed up about never having explored a tile. I’m okay with being the explorer as long as the curses don’t all pile up on me! Oh, did I forget to mention? The curses can pile up! You can be mute, with one hand on your head, and have 1 less die!! Ahh!! How are you suppose to unlock yourself with so many handicaps!

<br>

<b>“Go on, save yourself!”</b>
![Save Yourself](/img/galleries/escape-pics/escape_almostout.jpg)

Sometimes you just can’t be saved and you have to let your friends escape to safety without you. It usually happens with the lone explorer, but not always. When the gong rings (signaling the activation of the traps or the temple collasping), there's not much time left. Your dice could be locked or you could just be unlucky with your rolls. If your friends escape the temple before you, then they can give 1 player 1 of their dice. This allows the remaining player a slight advantage to escape safely.

Overall, it’s a really fun game that is only 10 minutes long. Want to make it more exciting? Play the soundtrack louder to get your heart pumping as you race against time to escape. Will you be able to safely escape this cursed temple with all your friends? Try it out and let me know what you think!
